# Houston
Houston is a network installer meant to be used with [NASA](http://rinnegatamante.it/board/showthread.php?tid=16).<br>
Starting from v.1.1 (Commit: [#10](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/Houston/commit/c5921a58196ea616f1a0f0226fa091d915425a58)) it can be considered a minimalist FTP client with only CWD and STOR implementations since NASA v.1.6 owns an FTP manager for imported contents managing and installation.<br>
If you want to see the code of old Houston (compatible with NASA v.1.0 - v.1.5), you can use [this commit](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/Houston/commit/838dc648462a2d7d5ae42603b8aa9e7e1cc2898f) as reference.
